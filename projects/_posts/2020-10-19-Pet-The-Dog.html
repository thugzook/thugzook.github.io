  My first foray into the world of game development, Unity and C#, <span class="font-semibold">Pet the Dog</span> is my very first personal project seen to completion.
  It features hand drawn art, dynamic instance generation and a loving dog. I created this project as a gift for my SO (spoiler alert: she loved it).
