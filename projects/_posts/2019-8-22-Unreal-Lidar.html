  This semester-long research project was focused on creating real-time VLP-16 LiDAR simulations using Unreal Engine and Microsoft AirSim.
  We simulated IR interactions with glass and compared it with real-world test data.

  <h2>Simulation Screens</h2>

  Features:
  <ul>
    <li>UDP packets streamed to UE4 from a VLP-16 using the Boost C++ library</li>
    <li>Intensity and distance based coloring</li>
    <li>Toggleable Minimap</li>
    <li>10Hz Refresh rate</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Side by side point cloud comparisons between our simulation and a real-world location. The green point cloud is simulated data and the red point cloud is our truth value.</p>
