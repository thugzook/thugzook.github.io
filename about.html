          I'm a student studying computer engineering at Georgia Tech. I've recently made the switch to software and have been self-teaching myself ever since.

          I love working on meaningful projects, cooking, and boxing. I've been developing full-stack web, iOS and AR applications at the Georiga Tech Research Institute,
          and I also work on a blockchain startup called Harpie.
